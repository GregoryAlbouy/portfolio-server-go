# portfolio2020-server-go

Backend-server for my portfolio https://gregoryalbouy.com written in Go + SQL (previously in Node.js + MongoDB)

I use it to access, store and manage project information using JWT authentication, and receive messages from the contact form â€“ which is quite unlikely to happen.
